### What I learned

I had no idea that the number cards were supposed to be made from pure html and css and that this challenge would be a difficult one for me. Since I have not learned any advanced CSS usages, I couldn't complete the bonus one. So, I did as far as what I knew what to do to tackle this challenge.

### Continued development

I would love to learn and do more challenges to improve my CSS skills.
